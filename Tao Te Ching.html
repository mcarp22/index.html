	<p>The <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, often called simply <strong lang="zh">Laozi</strong> after its reputed author, describes the <i lang="zh-Hant">Dao</i> (or <i lang="zh-Hant">Tao</i>) as the source and ideal of all existence: it is unseen, but not transcendent, immensely powerful yet supremely humble, being the root of all things. People have desires and free will (and thus are able to alter their own nature). Many act "unnaturally", upsetting the natural balance of the Tao. The <i>Tao Te Ching</i> intends to lead students to a "return" to their natural state, in harmony with Tao.<sup>[42]</sup> Language and conventional wisdom are critically assessed. Taoism views them as inherently biased and artificial, widely using paradoxes to sharpen the point.<sup>[43]</sup></p>

		<p>Olivia Kohn provides an example of how <strong lang="zh">Laozi</strong> encouraged a change in approach, or return to "nature", rather than action. Technology may bring about a false sense of progress. The answer provided by Laozi is not the rejection of technology, but instead seeking the calm state of <i lang="zh-Hant">wu wei</i>, free from desires. This relates to many statements by Laozi encouraging rulers to keep their people in "ignorance", or "simple-minded". Some scholars insist this explanation ignores the religious context, and others question it as an apologetic of the philosophical coherence of the text. It would not be unusual political advice if Laozi literally intended to tell rulers to keep their people ignorant. However, some terms in the text, such as "valley spirit" (<i lang="zh-Hant">gushen</i>) and "soul" (<i lang="zh-Hant">po</i>), bear a metaphysical context and cannot be easily reconciled with a purely ethical reading of the work.<sup>[43]</sup></p>
